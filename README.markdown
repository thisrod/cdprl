The point of this is explained in [the paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0404052).

Review requests
---------------

* There must be a better way to write Simulator.__init__
* Please suggest extra Greens functions to test
* TestDelta and TestDerivative aren't nearly thorough enough

Issues
------

Where should the noise be scaled by repulsion?

The n matrices for spin up and spin down are stored in a single array N.  The spin down elements go in N[0,:,:], spin up in N[1,:,:].  Thus the opposite spin is given by 1-spin.
